## üéÆ Overall Experimental Task: Trust Game

Participants engaged in a 10-round interactive multi-round trust game, where they played the role of the "Investor". In each round:
- The investor received an initial endowment of 20 tokens
- The investor decided how much to transfer to the trustee (0, 5, 10, 15, or 20 tokens)
- The investment was tripled by the experimenter before reaching the trustee
- The trustee decided how many tokens to return to the investor
- At the end of each round, participants saw the amount returned by the trustee

Note: The trustee's behavior was simulated by a computer algorithm (unknown to participants).

## üßÆ Computational Modeling Objective:

The goal is to model the investor's behavior across 10 rounds, considering multiple psychological and strategic factors:

**Available Parameters:**
- `inequalityAversion`: Social preference regarding outcome inequality
- `riskAversion`: Economic preference for risk
- `theoryOfMindSophistication`: Level of recursive perspective-taking about trustee's behavior
- `planning`: Forward-looking planning depth
- `irritability`: Sensitivity to negative outcomes (e.g., low returns)
- `irritationAwareness`: Awareness of one's own irritation effects
- `inverseTemperature`: Decision randomness/determinism

**State Information:**
- `round`: Current round number (0-9)
- `history`: List of tuples [(investor_action, trustee_action)] from previous rounds

## üîç Evaluation Task:

Please conduct a comprehensive theoretical evaluation of this computational model from the perspective of cognitive science and behavioral economics. Your evaluation should focus on **theoretical interpretability and mechanistic accuracy** rather than statistical fit alone.

### Evaluation Dimensions:

#### 1. **Payoff Calculation** (Yes / Partially / No)
- Does the model correctly specify the trust game's basic payoff structure?
- Are the economic outcomes (investor's final payoff) computed accurately?
- Is the tripling mechanism and return structure properly represented?

#### 2. **Subjective Utility - Economic Preference** (Yes / Partially / No)
- Is risk aversion appropriately modeled using established utility functions (e.g., power utility, exponential utility)?
- Does the model capture uncertainty about trustee's return behavior?
- Are expected utilities computed in a theoretically sound manner?

#### 3. **Subjective Utility - Social Preference** (Yes / Partially / No)
- Is inequality aversion formalized using recognized frameworks (e.g., Fehr-Schmidt model, Bolton-Ockenfels ERC)?
- Does the model distinguish between advantageous and disadvantageous inequality?
- Is irritation/anger toward low trustee returns modeled as a psychologically meaningful mechanism (not just as a simple additive term)?
- Are emotional responses (e.g., irritation) integrated in a theoretically coherent way?

#### 4. **Theory of Mind (ToM)** (Yes / Partially / No)
**Critical Assessment Points:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Common Flaw**: Does the model merely estimate the trustee's return rate from historical data (e.g., simple averaging)? If so, this is **conceptually insufficient**.
- ‚úì **Correct Approach**: Does the model implement recursive perspective-taking where:
  - The investor models the trustee's beliefs about the investor's strategy?
  - The trustee's behavior is predicted based on the trustee's own utility maximization?
  - There are multiple levels of strategic reasoning (level-0, level-1, level-2, etc.)?
- Does the ToM implementation capture the interdependency of beliefs in strategic interactions?

#### 5. **Planning** (Yes / Partially / No)
**Critical Assessment Points:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Common Flaw**: Is planning implemented as a simple additive term or scaling factor? If so, this is **conceptually inaccurate**.
- ‚úì **Correct Approach**: Does the model use recursive/dynamic planning methods such as:
  - Bellman equations for multi-step lookahead?
  - Value iteration or backward induction?
  - Explicit modeling of future states and expected future utilities?
- Does the planning depth parameter meaningfully affect the decision process through proper recursion?

#### 6. **Overall Code Interpretability** (0-100 scale)
- Are psychological constructs clearly defined and implemented?
- Is the model architecture transparent and followable?
- Are parameter meanings aligned with their cognitive/economic interpretations?
- Does the model avoid unnecessary complexity while capturing essential mechanisms?

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes:

1. **Prioritize theoretical soundness over statistical fit**: A model with perfect BIC may still be mechanistically implausible.
2. **Be especially critical of oversimplifications**: Simple additive terms for complex constructs like planning or irritation are red flags.
3. **Theory of Mind is typically the hardest**: Most models fail here by treating it as simple pattern recognition rather than recursive reasoning.
4. **Alignment with cognitive science principles**: The model should reflect established theories (e.g., prospect theory for risk, Bellman equations for planning, level-k reasoning for ToM).
